## Introduction

The Montesano Fish Program is conducting it's first Intro to R for Ecologists workshop this June. The workshop is geared towards people who have never programmed or have limited programming experience in R.

The workshop curriculum will closely mirror this publicly available Data Carpentry workshop "Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists". However, the course has been shortened and data sets and challenge examples have been tailored to be more applicable to fish program work.


## DAY 1

### 8:00 am Introduction

Welcome to the first Fish Program Intro to R course! I started coding in R as a undergrad and now have about 11 years of experience. Five years ago I became a certified
Data Carpentry instructor, which means I have taken several of their courses, taught several courses, and took a course in the pedagogical style of the Carpentries, and edited the online curriculum. I really enjoy teaching and working with data and I’m excited to be teaching this course along with several amazing helpers, Matthew Siskey, Marlene Wagner, and MAtthew George.

This course begins with the assumption that you have no prior experience coding at all in any language and the curriculum is designed to build on itself throughout the course. Our main goal by the end of the course is for students to be able to load their own data into R, calculate some standard statistics, do exploratory plotting and analysis, and be able to manipulate code that other people have written.

We are basing the curriculum and pedagogical style of this course off of the Data Carpentry Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists course [course](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).

For information regarding the schedule, helpful Data Carpentry resources, links to the code we will generate, and links to the collaborative etherpad document, please see our github repository [link](https://github.com/erinwitkop-DFW/Intro_to_R_Monte_2024)

We are going to use a collaborative etherpad document at several points
during the course. The link for the etherpad is
[here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/Intro_R_Monte_2024).

Next I want to more formally introduce our helpers for the workshop.
Every day we will have one helper who is knowledgeable in R.
Their role is to help troubleshoot any individual problems or error
codes you may have that you are not able to figure out. Whenever you
need help, raise up your red sticky note and a helper will come over
and see if they can assist you. At some points in the course I’ll check
in regarding the pace and ask you to put up a green sticky
note if you feel good, or red if I need to slow down.

I do want to point out that there are a lot of things to know about R,
but the goal of this course is to help you build confidence and know
that you find answers to your own questions.

### 8:10 am - 8:45am: Before we Start

-   What is R? What is RStudio?
    -   The term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the
    software that interprets the scripts written using it. RStudio is a popular
    way to write R scripts and interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.
    
-   Why learn R?
    -   R does not involve a lot of pointing and clicking. In R, the results 
    of your analysis rely on a series of written commands, and not on remembering
    a succession of pointing and clicking. That is a good thing! So, if you
    want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have
    to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results.
    With a stored series of commands in an R script, you can repeat running them 
    and R will process the new dataset exactly the same way as before. Working
    with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code
    you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and 
    spot mistakes.Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.
    
    -   R is great for reproducibility (meaning someone else can get the same 
    results as you from the same analysis with the same data).
    
    -   R is widely used in several other fields like biotech and academia where 
    analyses are expected to be reproducible. Knowing these skills can give you a leg up.
    
    -   R can integrate new and existing tools
    
    -   R is interdiscipinary and extensible. With 10,000+ packages that can be
    installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you
    to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, 
    population genetics, and a lot more.
    
    -   R works on data of all shapes and sizes and types
    
    -   Its free and is open source, meaning that anyone can open the source code 
    an inspect it (unlike other programs like Excel, SASS or Prism which are not open source)
    
    -   R produces high quality graphics
    
    -   R has a large helpful community, including platforms like Stack Overflow 


#### Knowing your way around R and R studio

Let’s start by learning about RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3. The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, PBC.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

RStudio is divided into 4 “panes”:

-   The Source for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout)
-   Your Environment/History (top-right) which shows all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)
-   Your Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right)
-   The R Console (bottom-left)

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout). For ease of use, settings such as background color, font color, font size, and zoom level can also be adjusted in this menu (Global Options -> Appearance).

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone.

#### Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of
the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that
indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to
absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer).
Working this way allows you to move your project around on your computer
and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the
underlying scripts will still work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its
“Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for
you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate
to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and (re-)open files to
assist resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an
“R Project” for this tutorial below.

1.  Start RStudio.
2.  Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`. Choose
    `New Directory`, then `New Project`.
3.  Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a
    convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for
    the rest of the course (e.g., \~/data-carpentry).
4.  Click on Create Project.

A workspace is your current working environment in R which includes any
user-defined object. By default, all of these objects will be saved, and
automatically loaded, when you reopen your project.

#### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep
things organized, and will help you to find/file things in the future.
This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In
general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and
documents.

Let’s create a few new folders to hold input and output for us in our
repository - `/Data_raw/` - `/Scripts/` - `/Figures/` - `/Results/` - `/Data/`

#### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the
place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you
write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the
root of your working directory and only need files within this
structure.

RStudio assists you in this regard and sets the working directory
automatically to the directory where you have placed your project in. If
you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some reason your
working directory is not what it should be you can use
`setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset your working directory.

Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and
create a folder named data_raw within your newly created working directory
(e.g., ~/data-carpentry/). (Alternatively, type dir.create("data_raw") at
your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a data and a fig folder.

#### Interacting with R

What we are writing is *code* or the instructions to tell R how to run.
We call the instructions *commands* and then we execute the commands by
running the code.

You can either run code directly through the console and press `Enter`,
or by writing your commands in a script and running them using the `Run`
button or a keyboard shortcut. For example, I run my commands in R on a
mac using COMMAND+ENTER.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or 
by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The 
console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where 
commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately
by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands
that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console
and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

For reproducibility its best to write your code down in R and using the
number (#) sign to include comments. Any line or part of a line starting
with a number sign will be ignored by R. It’s really important to
comment your code, both for yourself and for sharing what you have done
with others.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a > prompt. 
If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from
the script editor using Ctrl + Enter), R will try to execute it, 
and when ready, will show the results and come back with a 
new > prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t 
complete yet, the console will show a + prompt. It means that you haven’t
finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not 
‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same 
number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number
of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you
thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console
window and press Esc; this will cancel the incomplete command and 
return you to the > prompt.

#### Seeking help

You can search functions by typing `?mean()` in the console or also
through the help tab in R studio. If you are looking for a function to
do a particular task, but don’t know the function name, you can use 
the double question mark ??, for example ??kruskall. Both commands 
will open matching help files in RStudio’s help panel in the lower 
right corner. You can also use the help panel to search help directly,
as seen in the screenshot.Looking up commands is really useful
for understanding the arguments that each one takes and how to use it
properly!

#### Automatic Code Completion

When you start typing code in R you can use tab completion to finish a
command or object name that you were typing by hitting the tab button.

#### Package Vignettes and cheat sheets

In addition to the documentation for individual functions, many 
packages have vignettes – instructions for how to use the package 
to do certain tasks. Vignettes are great for learning by example. 
Vignettes are accessible via the package help and by using the function`browseVignettes(`.

There is also a Help menu at the top of the RStudio window, that has
cheat sheets for popular packages, RStudio keyboard shortcuts, and more.

#### Finding more packages and functions

RStudio’s help only searches the packages that you have installed on your machine, 
but there are many more available on CRAN and GitHub. To search across all
available R packages, you can use the website rdocumentation.org. Often, 
a generic Google or internet search “R <task>” will send you to the appropriate
package documentation or a forum where someone else has already asked your question. 
Many packages also have websites with additional help, tutorials,
news and more (for example tidyverse.org).


#### Dealing with Error Messages

Don’t get discouraged if your code doesn’t run immediately! Error
messages are common when programming, and fixing errors is part of any
programmer’s daily work. Often, the problem is a small typo in a
variable name or a missing parenthesis. Watch for the red x’s next to
your code in RStudio. These may provide helpful hints about the source
of the problem.

RStudio shows a red x next to a line of code that R doesn’t understand.

If you can’t fix an error yourself, start by googling it. Some error
messages are too generic to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of
bounds”). In that case it might help to include the name of the function
or package you’re using in your query.

#### Asking for Help

If your Google search is unsuccessful, you may want to ask other R users for help. There are different places where you can ask for help. During this workshop, don’t hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help. You might also be interested in organizing regular meetings following the workshop to keep learning from each other. If you have a friend or colleague with more experience than you, they might also be able and willing to help you.

Besides that, there are a few places on the internet that provide help:

  - Stack Overflow: Many questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in your search to find them. If your question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on how to ask a good question.
  - The R-help mailing list: it is used by a lot of people (including most of the R core team). If your question is valid (read its Posting Guide), you are likely to get an answer very fast, but the tone can be pretty dry and it is not always very welcoming to new users.
  - If your question is about a specific package rather than a base R function, see if there is a mailing list for the package. Usually it’s included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can be accessed using packageDescription("<package-name>").
  - You can also try to contact the package author directly, by emailing them or opening an issue on the code repository (e.g., on GitHub).
  - There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc…). The complete list is on the R mailing lists website.

The key to receiving help from someone is for them to rapidly grasp your problem. Thus, you should be as precise as possible when describing your problem and help others to pinpoint where the issue might be. Try to…

  - Use the correct words to describe your problem. Otherwise you might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than answering your question.

  - Generalize what you are trying to do, so people outside your field can understand the question.

  - Reduce what does not work to a simple reproducible example. For instance, instead of using your real data set, create a small generic one. For more information on how to write a reproducible example see this article from the reprex package. Learning how to use the reprex package is also very helpful for this.

  - Include the output of sessionInfo() in your question. It provides information about your platform, the versions of R and the packages that you are using. As an example, here you can see the versions of R and all the packages that we are using to run the code in this lesson:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

***

## Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign *values* to
*objects*. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator we will use in this course. It assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`.   For historical reasons, you can also use `=`
for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the
[slight](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html)
[differences](https://renkun.me/2014/01/28/difference-between-assignment-operators-in-r/)
in syntax, it is good practice to always use `<-` for assignments.

In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd> at the
same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) will write `<-` in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push <kbd>Option</kbd> at the
same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) does the same in a Mac.

Objects can be given almost any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or `subject_id`. Here are some further guidelines on naming objects:

- You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
- They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is).
- R is case sensitive, so for example, `Weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`.
- There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
  [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
  for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
  other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). If in
  doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use.
- It's best to avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages. To avoid confusion, don't include dots in names.
- It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
- Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Styles can include "lower\_snake", "UPPER\_SNAKE", "lowerCamelCase", "UpperCamelCase", etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides come from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), [Jean
  Fan](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the
  [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse style is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the [**`lintr`**](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package to automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

### Objects vs. variables

What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words
are used synonymously. For more information see:
[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one: Note that is overwrites! 

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
other objects. For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
object, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

### Saving your code

Up to now, your code has been in the console. This is useful for quick queries
but not so helpful if you want to revisit your work for any reason.
A script can be opened by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>N</kbd>.
It is wise to save your script file immediately. To do this press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. This will open a dialogue box where you
can decide where to save your script file, and what to name it.
The `.R` file extension is added automatically and ensures your file
will open with RStudio.

Don't forget to save your work periodically by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>S</kbd>.

### Comments

The comment character in R is `#`.  Anything to the right of a `#` in a script
will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your
scripts.
For convenience, RStudio provides a keyboard shortcut to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the
lines you  want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If you only want to comment
out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need
to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>C</kbd>.

### Challenge

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r, purl=FALSE}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
```

## age  <- age - 20        # age?
## mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
```

### Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands
including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
usually takes one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)
```

Here, the value of 10 is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `weight_kg`. This function takes one argument, other functions might take several.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to
use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value
of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)` to find what
arguments it takes, or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
args(round)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?round
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
type `digits = 2` or however many we want.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.

## Vectors and data types

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be
either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using
the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign
it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R
will assume objects have been created called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects
don't exist in R's memory, there will be an error message.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.
The function `class()` indicates what kind of object you are working with:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its
elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`,
add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
`weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result
back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset.
As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or
calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw
2 of the 6 main **atomic vector** types  that R
uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"` (or `"double"`). These are the basic building blocks that
all R objects are built from. The other 4 **atomic vector** types are:

- `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
- `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
- `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,
  `1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
- `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting your vector as the argument.

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`),
factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Challenge

- We've seen that atomic vectors can be of type character,
  numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in
  a single vector?

::::::: solution

R implicitly converts them to all be the same type

::::::::::::::::

- What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()`
  to check the data type of your objects):
  
```{r }
  num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
  num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
  char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
  tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

- Why do you think it happens?

::::::: solution

Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to
convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common
denominator" that doesn't lose any information.

## 9:45-10:00 Introduction to R- continued

## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the C
family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's
simpler for computers to do.

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r,  purl=FALSE}
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

Here, `>` for "greater than", `<` stands for "less than", `<=` for "less than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat", "cat")

# return both rat and cat
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"]

# return a logical vector that is TRUE for the elements within animals
# that are found in the character vector and FALSE for those that are not
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")

# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals
# that are found in the character vector
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Challenge (optional){.challenge}

- Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?

::::::: solution

When using ">" or "\<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order.
Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.

::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing
values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Challenge

1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.
  
  ```r
  heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
  ```

2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

:::::::: solution

```{r, answer=TRUE}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.
heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
# or
heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]

# 2.
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3.
heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)
```

:::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R's data
structures, we are ready to start working with the carcass dataset and learn about data frames.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `<-` is used to assign values on the right to objects on the left
- Code should be saved within the Source pane in RStudio to help you return to your code later.  
- '#' can be used to add comments to your code. 
- Functions can automate more complicated sets of commands, and require arguments as inputs.
- Vectors are composed by a series of values and can take many forms. 
- Data structures in R include 'vector', 'list', 'matrix', 'data.frame', 'factor', and 'array'.
- Vectors can be subset by indexing or through logical vectors.
- Many functions exist to remove missing data from data structures.

What we just loaded was a dataframe, the typical data structure used in
R for tabular data while we will use for statistics and plotting.

In a dataframe, columns are vectors of the same length and same type of
data.

``` r
# Based on the output of str(data), what is the class of our data object? How many rows and columns are there? 

str(data)
```

#### Indexing and subsetting data frames

To extract data from a dataframe we need to use its coordinates, which
are always row number followed by column number.

``` r
# get first row and column
data[1,1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   Sample.ID   
    ##   <chr>       
    ## 1 SWB343927719

``` r
# You can save this by assigning it to a variable
data_subset <- data[1,1]

# get only 5th columns
data[,5]
```

    ## # A tibble: 299 × 1
    ##    sex   
    ##    <chr> 
    ##  1 male

Challenge time!

``` r
# Create a data.frame (data_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.
data_200 <- data[200,]

# Pull out the last row of the data frame and save it
nrow(data) # 299
```

    ## [1] 299

``` r
data_last <- data[299,]
```

Let’s take five minutes for this challenge so you can have a breather
before starting the final piece of our first day!

#### Factors

Several of our data columns contain character data that are categorical
variables. `Factor` is a special class used for working with categorical
data. Factors only contain a list of pre-defined levels. Though factors
may often look like character vectors, they are actually treated as
integer vectors, so you need to be careful when treating them as
strings.

``` r
# Use the factor function to convert column levels to factors 
data$sex <- factor(data$sex) 

# check the conversion worked with summary and class
summary(data$sex)
```

    ## female   male 
    ##    125    174

``` r
class(data$sex)
```

    ## [1] "factor"

``` r
# Note that factors are always assigned in alphabetical order. Check the levels of a factor with levels
levels(data$sex) # see that female comes before male
```

    ## [1] "female" "male"

``` r
# Get the number of levels with n level 
nlevels(data$sex)
```

    ## [1] 2

Sometimes you may want your levels in specific order.

``` r
data$sex <- factor(data$sex, levels = c("male","female"))
levels(data$sex)
```

    ## [1] "male"   "female"

Challenge

``` r
# Convert the HigestCare column to a factor and put the levels in this order: Neg, Floor, CCU, Outpatient

levels(as.factor(data$HighestCare)) # "CCU"        "Floor"      "Neg"        "Outpatient"
```

    ## [1] "CCU"        "Floor"      "Neg"        "Outpatient"

``` r
data$HighestCare <- factor(data$HighestCare, levels = c("Neg","Floor","CCU","Outpatient"))
```

#### Converting factors

To convert a factor to character vector you can use `as.character(x)`

``` r
as.character(data$sex)
```

    ##   [1] "male"   "male"   "male"   "male"   "male"   "female" "female" "female"
    ##   [9] "male"   "male"   "male"   "female" "male"   "male"   "male"   "female"

#### Renaming Factors

With your data stored as factors you can use the `plot()` function to
quickly see the number of observations in each factor level

``` r
plot(data$HighestCare)
```

![](Full_Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022_files/figure-gfm/plot_factor-1.png)<!-- -->
However say we wanted to rename the Negative group from Neg to Negative.

``` r
levels(data$HighestCare)[1] <- "Negative"
plot(data$HighestCare)
```

![](Full_Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022_files/figure-gfm/rename_factor-1.png)<!-- -->
We can also use this to rename any NA levels we may have. For example,
lets make the `Ever.On.Ventilator` column a factor and plot it.

``` r
data$Ever.On.Ventilator <- factor(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
plot(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
```

![](Full_Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022_files/figure-gfm/rename-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# But what about the NAs samples that we know are there?

# turn the missing values into a factor levels with the addNA() function
data$Ever.On.Ventilator <- addNA(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
levels(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
```

    ## [1] "N" "Y" NA

``` r
# And rename the NA
levels(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)[3] <- "Not Applicable"

# now we can replot and see this new added level
plot(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
```

![](Full_Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022_files/figure-gfm/rename-2.png)<!-- -->
Challenge!

``` r
# Now that we have renamed the Ever.On.Ventilator column, can you reorder the levels so that the "Not Applicable" patients are plotted before  the "N" patients?
data$Ever.On.Ventilator <- factor(data$Ever.On.Ventilator, levels = c("Not Applicable","N","Y"))

plot(data$Ever.On.Ventilator)
```

![](Full_Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022_files/figure-gfm/challenge_7-1.png)<!-- -->
#### Saving and exporting data

Now that we have done a variety of data manipulations, we want to save
our output.

``` r
# lets output in our results folder
write.csv(data, file="Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022/results/data_day1.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

When you close out R Studio you will see the option to save your current
session objects. I typically do, though sometimes this can get you into
troubl as you are approaching the edge of R’s memory.

### BREAK 11:00-11:15

### 11:15am-12:00pm: Manipulating Data in R

Using brackets to subset data can be cumbersome, so in comes the `dplyr`
package which has a set of functions designed for tabular data
manipulation. The `tidyverse` package we loaded yesterday already
includes this package as well as a few others, like `ggplot2`, `tidyr`
which we will use today. The `tidyr` allows for more simple reshaping of
the data for plotting and other data analysis tasks. Note that online
and in R studio there are helpful cheatsheets that have a list of
functions in both `dplyr` and `tidyr` that are very useful references.

To access go to `Help` \> `Cheatsheets`

``` r
# Note that every time you restart R you need to reload your packages

library(tidyverse)

# Let's also load in our data that we exported yesterday at the end of our session
data2 <- read_csv("Data_Carpentry_Workshop_2022/results/data_day1.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 299 Columns: 29
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (11): Sample.ID, Covid.ID, sex, race, patientType, HighestCare, Ever.On....
    ## dbl (18): drawDate, Score, age, bmi, admitDate, deceasedDate, drawTime, toci...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Now we’re going to learn some of the most useful `dplyr` data
manipulation functions.

-   `select()`: subset columns
-   `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
-   `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other
    columns
-   `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped
    data
-   `arrange()`: sort results
-   `count()`: count discrete values

#### Selecting columns and filtering rows

``` r
select(data2, Sample.ID, age, bmi) # put the name of the df first, followed by the columns names
```

#### Pipes

What if you want to filter and select at the same time? You can either
do this in intermediate steps, nesting functions, or running the
functions one after the other on the same dataset using pipes.

``` r
# Intermediate steps
data2_subset <- filter(data2, bmi < 30)
data2_subset <- select(data2_subset, Sample.ID, age, severity)

# Nest the functions
data2_subset <- select(filter(data2, bmi < 30), Sample.ID, age, severity)

# nesting  can get hard to read

# Use the pipe operator %>% 
# Pipes in R look like %>% and are made available via the magrittr package, installed automatically with dplyr. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with Ctrl + Shift + M if you have a PC or Cmd + Shift + M if you have a Mac.

data2 %>%
  filter(bmi < 30) %>% 
  select(Sample.ID, age, severity)
```

    ## # A tibble: 146 × 3
    ##    Sample.ID       age severity
    ##    <chr>         <dbl> <chr>   
    ##  1 SWB386069501     67 Neg     
    ##  2 SWB827655421     67 Neg     
    ##  3 SWB200026065     37 Neg     
    ##  4 SWB258824496     65 Neg     
    ##  5 SWB733482852     94 Neg     
    ##  6 SWB1084971930    79 Neg     
    ##  7 SWB1078357262    75 Neg     
    ##  8 SWB555276334     75 Neg     
    ##  9 SWB1035736641    88 Neg     
    ## 10 SWB258122016     88 Neg     
    ## # … with 136 more rows

``` r
# the pipe passes the data from one operation to another and goes step by step, it is like saying the word "then" at each pipe 

# We can create a new object with this filtered data
data2_sml <- data2 %>%
  filter(bmi < 30) %>% 
  select(Sample.ID, age, severity)

data2_sml
```

    ## # A tibble: 146 × 3

    ## # … with 136 more rows

Challenge

``` r
# Using pipes, subset data2 to keep only patients with a COVID score at or below 4, whose highest care was NOT CCU, and retain only their Sample.ID, age, sex, and bmi.

data2_subset <- data2 %>% 
  filter(Score <= 4) %>% 
  filter(HighestCare != "CCU" ) %>%
  select(Sample.ID, age,sex, bmi)
```

#### Mutate

It is often the case that you want to perform some manipulation on an
existing column and make a new column. You can do this using the
function `mutate`

``` r
# lets create a new column where we calculate a persons age in months
data2 %>%
  mutate(age_months = age*12)
```

    ## # A tibble: 299 × 30
    ##    Sample.ID     drawDate Covid.ID     Score sex     age race    bmi patientType
