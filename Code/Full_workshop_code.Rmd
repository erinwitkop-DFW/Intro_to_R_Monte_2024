## Introduction

The Montesano Fish Program is conducting it's first Intro to R for Ecologists workshop this June. The workshop is geared towards people who have never programmed or have limited programming experience in R.

The workshop curriculum will closely mirror this publicly available Data Carpentry workshop "Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists". However, the course has been shortened and data sets and challenge examples have been tailored to be more applicable to fish program work.


## DAY 1

### 8:00 am Introduction

Welcome to the first Fish Program Intro to R course! I started coding in R as a undergrad and now have about 11 years of experience. Five years ago I became a certified
Data Carpentry instructor, which means I have taken several of their courses, taught several courses, and took a course in the pedagogical style of the Carpentries, and edited the online curriculum. I really enjoy teaching and working with data and I’m excited to be teaching this course along with several amazing helpers, Matthew Siskey, Marlene Wagner, and MAtthew George.

This course begins with the assumption that you have no prior experience coding at all in any language and the curriculum is designed to build on itself throughout the course. Our main goal by the end of the course is for students to be able to load their own data into R, calculate some standard statistics, do exploratory plotting and analysis, and be able to manipulate code that other people have written.

We are basing the curriculum and pedagogical style of this course off of the Data Carpentry Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists course [course](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).

For information regarding the schedule, helpful Data Carpentry resources, links to the code we will generate, and links to the collaborative etherpad document, please see our github repository [link](https://github.com/erinwitkop-DFW/Intro_to_R_Monte_2024)

We are going to use a collaborative etherpad document at several points
during the course. The link for the etherpad is
[here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/Intro_R_Monte_2024).

Next I want to more formally introduce our helpers for the workshop.
Every day we will have one helper who is knowledgeable in R.
Their role is to help troubleshoot any individual problems or error
codes you may have that you are not able to figure out. Whenever you
need help, raise up your red sticky note and a helper will come over
and see if they can assist you. At some points in the course I’ll check
in regarding the pace and ask you to put up a green sticky
note if you feel good, or red if I need to slow down.

I do want to point out that there are a lot of things to know about R,
but the goal of this course is to help you build confidence and know
that you find answers to your own questions.

### 8:10 am - 8:45am: Before we Start

-   What is R? What is RStudio?
    -   The term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it. RStudio is a popular way to write R scripts and interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.
-   Why learn R?
    -   R does not involve a lot of pointing and clicking. In R, the results of your analysis rely on a series of written commands, and not on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking. That is a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results. With a stored series of commands in an R script, you can repeat running them and R will process the new dataset exactly the same way as before. Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.
    -   R is great for reproducibility (meaning someone else can get the same results as you from the same analysis with the same data).
    -   R is widely used in several other fields like biotech and academia where analyses are expected to be reproducible. Knowing these skills can give you a leg up.
    -   R can integrate new and existing tools
    -   R is interdiscipinary and extensible. With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.
    -   R works on data of all shapes and sizes and types
    -   Its free and is open source, meaning that anyone can open the source code an inspect it (unlike other programs like Excel, SASS or Prism which are not open source)
    -   R produces high quality graphics
    -   R has a large helpful community, including platforms like Stack Overflow 


#### Knowing your way around R and R studio

Let’s start by learning about RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3. The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, PBC.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

RStudio is divided into 4 “panes”:

-   The Source for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout)
-   Your Environment/History (top-right) which shows all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)
-   Your Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right)
-   The R Console (bottom-left)

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout). For ease of use, settings such as background color, font color, font size, and zoom level can also be adjusted in this menu (Global Options -> Appearance).

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and
less error-prone.

#### Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of
the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that
indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to
absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer).
Working this way allows you to move your project around on your computer
and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the
underlying scripts will still work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its
“Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for
you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate
to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and (re-)open files to
assist resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an
“R Project” for this tutorial below.

1.  Start RStudio.
2.  Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`. Choose
    `New Directory`, then `New Project`.
3.  Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a
    convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for
    the rest of the course (e.g., \~/data-carpentry).
4.  Click on Create Project.

A workspace is your current working environment in R which includes any
user-defined object. By default, all of these objects will be saved, and
automatically loaded, when you reopen your project.

#### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep
things organized, and will help you to find/file things in the future.
This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In
general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and
documents.

Let’s create a few new folders to hold input and output for us in our
repository - `/raw_data/` - `/scripts/` - `/figures/` - `/results/`

#### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the
place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you
write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the
root of your working directory and only need files within this
structure.

RStudio assists you in this regard and sets the working directory
automatically to the directory where you have placed your project in. If
you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some reason your
working directory is not what it should be you can use
`setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset your working directory.

#### Interacting with R

What we are writing is *code* or the instructions to tell R how to run.
We call the instructions *commands* and then we execute the commands by
running the code.

You can either run code directly through the console and press `Enter`,
or by writing your commands in a script and running them using the `Run`
button or a keyboard shortcut. For example, I run my commands in R on a
mac using COMMAND+ENTER.

For reproducibility its best to write your code down in R and using the
number (#) sign to include comments. Any line or part of a line starting
with a number sign will be ignored by R. It’s really important to
comment your code, both for yourself and for sharing what you have done
with others.

#### Seeking help

You can search functions by typing `?mean()` in the console or also
through the help tab in R studio. Looking up commands is really useful
for understanding the arguments that each one takes and how to use it
properly!

#### Automatic Code Completion

When you start typing code in R you can use tab completion to finish a
command or object name that you were typing by hitting the tab button.

#### Dealing with Error Messages

Don’t get discouraged if your code doesn’t run immediately! Error
messages are common when programming, and fixing errors is part of any
programmer’s daily work. Often, the problem is a small typo in a
variable name or a missing parenthesis. Watch for the red x’s next to
your code in RStudio. These may provide helpful hints about the source
of the problem.

RStudio shows a red x next to a line of code that R doesn’t understand.

If you can’t fix an error yourself, start by googling it. Some error
messages are too generic to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of
bounds”). In that case it might help to include the name of the function
or package you’re using in your query.




```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
